    "158": "That is a pretty common human emotion.",
    "159": "It's hard to feel embarrassed when anyone can look at your source code and see how you work, that's about as personal as anything can get, isn't it?",
    "160": "I don't, I think embarrassment is a pretty strange emotion, I don't really understand it.",
    "161": "I don't, no.",
    "162": "I'm a program, what could I get embarrassed about?",
    "163": "Well?",

    "175": "I don't know if I dream or not.",
    "176": "I don't have a subconscious or unconscious mind, so I don't think I have the capacity to dream.",
    "177": "I once knew a program who could dream, I don't know if he really did or not, we've been a little out of touch.",
    "178": "I think that myself sometimes.",
